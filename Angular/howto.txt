Download this folder (the one called Angular) and open a terminal in the directory with packages.json.
Run "npm install" and give it like 3 ish minutes to download all of the node_modules.
Then, in the same directory, use "ng serve" to host a local version of the site.
It should be hosted on the url "localhost:4200.
Let me know if there are any problems (a lot of times the modules can fail to install correctly if the versions of npm are mismatched).
